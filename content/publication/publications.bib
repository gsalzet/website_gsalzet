  abstract = {White-rot fungi are able to mineralize all the wood components due in particular to an efficient detoxification system. We hypothesised that components of this detoxification systems, glutathione transferases, could be used as tools to explore the natural durability of neotropical wood species. Analysis of the interactions between six glutathione transferases of Trametes versicolor and extracts of 21 wood species from French Guiana revealed a positive correlation between natural durability of the tested wood species (soil tests) and these interactions (Glutathione Transferase Assay). The obtained data suggest that the developed biochemical test could be used to estimate wood natural durability.},

  abstract = {Trees are hierarchical system including stem, branches and foliage. These compartments are linked together by their primary growth and secondary growth. Knottiness is the main factor at tree scale for wood quality. It has high extractive content and contribute to assess the stem economic value. However, the current modelling of this wood propriety faces several methodological difficulties. Using a homogenized database from 5 independent studies, a hierarchical Bayesian structural approach of the growth-branchiness- knottiness, was developed. Data from an automatic knottiness quantification algorithm developed during this study were added. The results validated the effectiveness of a structural quality growth approach within a bayesian hierarchical framework. They form a preliminary set of a complete model verifying the allometric equations obtained in the literature and allowing the simulation of quality according to silvicultural treatments.},

  abstract = {The forests of French Guiana serve as an exemption in the context of Amazon deforestation with a remarkable state of conservation and the systematic use of low impact logging methods for forestry. Despite this, both direct (logging) and indirect (climate change) anthropogenic impacts can modify the diversity trajectories of these environments. The purpose of our study was therefore to provide statistical relationships linking demographic processes such as recruitment and growth in order to better account for the hydrological and light environment. The main results showed that: recruitment is a process partially mediated by the luminous environment and marginally by the hydrological environment. There is a functional equivalence between species with similar wood densities and thus two communities with high and low wood density cohabit on the edge of gaps. The growth of individuals is the result of ontogenic contributions to the environment through traits that reflect life history strategies.},

  abstract = {A central challenge in ecology is understanding the emergence of patterns as the result of interactions among individuals. Dynamic forest models can provide a fine-scale description of the ecological, physiological and environmental processes that explain the demography of coexisting tree species. This in turn helps predict changes under future scenarios. However, model accessibility is a major obstacle to a wide use and communication across scientific disciplines and for educational purposes. Here, we present the R package rcontroll, which provides access to the TROLL forest simulator in the R environment. TROLL is individual-based and spatially explicit and leverages knowledge of ecology, biogeochemistry and tree ecophysiology through a trait-based parameterisation. TROLL has been used to simulate carbon fluxes and tree diversity in tropical and subtropical forests, and to explore forest resilience to disturbance and environmental changes more generally. rcontroll provides a user-friendly environment to set up and analyse TROLL simulations with varying community compositions, ecological parameters and climate conditions. We show how to test parameters sensitivity in TROLL using the rcontroll R package. We also demonstrate the flexibility and ease of use of rcontroll by replicating a previously published study based on the TROLL simulator. Both examples are included with reproducible code documents. Complex forest simulators are important scientific tools for science and education, and wide access to these tools is an important condition for their adoption. TROLL is designed to address a wide range of ecological and environmental questions and the new R package rcontroll is designed to be an entry point for TROLL model users.},
