 abstract = {The forests of French Guiana serve as an exemption in the context of Amazon deforestation with a remarkable state of conservation and the systematic use of low impact logging methods for forestry. Despite this, both direct (logging) and indirect (climate change) anthropogenic impacts can modify the diversity trajectories of these environments. The purpose of our study was therefore to provide statistical relationships linking demographic processes such as recruitment and growth in order to better account for the hydrological and light environment. The main results showed that: recruitment is a process partially mediated by the luminous environment and marginally by the hydrological environment. There is a functional equivalence between species with similar wood densities and thus two communities with high and low wood density cohabit on the edge of gaps. The growth of individuals is the result of ontogenic contributions to the environment through traits that reflect life history strategies.},
