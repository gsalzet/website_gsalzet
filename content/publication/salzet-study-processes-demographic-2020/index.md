abstract: 'The forests of French Guiana serve as an exemption in the context of Amazon
  deforestation with a remarkable state of conservation and the systematic use of
  low impact logging methods for forestry. Despite this, both direct (logging) and
  indirect (climate change) anthropogenic impacts can modify the diversity trajectories
  of these environments. The purpose of our study was therefore to provide statistical
  relationships linking demographic processes such as recruitment and growth in order
  to better account for the hydrological and light environment. The main results showed
  that: recruitment is a process partially mediated by the luminous environment and
  marginally by the hydrological environment. There is a functional equivalence between
  species with similar wood densities and thus two communities with high and low wood
  density cohabit on the edge of gaps. The growth of individuals is the result of
  ontogenic contributions to the environment through traits that reflect life history
  strategies.'
