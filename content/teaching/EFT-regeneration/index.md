**Abstract:** Forest regeneration is governed by regeneration of tree species and individuals, regulated by biotic and abiotic factors.
In this study we were interested in the spatial distribution of three tree species at the seedling stage at the Paracou
experimental site: Dicorynia guianensis, Symphonia globulifera and Tachigali melinonii. Our results highlight a strong
aggregated pattern distribution for all three species. Seedling density is highly structured by distance to the Nearest
Adult Neighbour (NAN) concurrent with species’ dispersion strategy and Janzen-Connell hypothesis. We used Digital
Canopy Model (DCM) to estimate light availability, distance to the nearest water the courses and Topographic Wetness
Index (TW!I) to characterise soil moisture. D. guianensis’ seedlings were mosily found in light areas (mean DCM of 28.88
meters) and S. globulifera on hydromorphic soil (mean Chanel Distance of 0.39 meters, mean TWI of 38.84). Contrary to
bibliographic sources, T. melinonii's seedlings were found in shade areas (DCM of 33.64 meters). This could be due to
competition with D. guianensis excluding T. melinoniïs seedling from light areas, and plasticity toward light allowing its
seedlings to grow in drained shade areas.
