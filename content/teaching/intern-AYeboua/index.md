**Abstract:** The forest sector in French Guiana is faced with the challenge of preserving biodiversity and
ecosystem services and developing the value of wood to meet the growing need for raw
materials and energy. To meet these challenges, the sector’s stakeholders have agreed on two
goals: (1) tripling timber production and (2) increasing wood energy production tenfold by
2029. In a sector that brings together actors with different stakes, how do they interact to meet
the population’s growing need for wood? The answer to this question is to determine whether
the current network of relationships allows the sector to meet these objectives.
By mobilizing the framework of the sociology of organized action, we observed that the actors
have behaviors turned towards unbalanced power strategies in favor of the actors of the first
transformation but structured and regulated by permanent negotiations.
The achievement of the sector’s sustainability objectives requires the implementation of action
strategies aimed at the transparency of commercial exchanges between actors and which allow
for a long-term vision of wood needs.
