abstract: 'Hydrological and edaphic gradients are known to determine local community assembly in tropicalforests, but are often summarised in discrete categories. These approaches disregard the continuousresponse of species abundance to waterlogging. This methodological issue is critical in the contextof climate change because water gradient at a local scale is expected to fluctuate due to unstable rainpatterns. The use of a continuous proxy for soil moisture such as the Topographic Wetness Index(TWI) overcomes the limits of punctual measurements with hydrological grounded algorithms. TheTWI allows the interpolation of the soil moisture based solely on the topography. Taking advantageof interpolation property, the TWI recently unveiled a pervasive hydro-edaphic niche differentiationmechanism in neotropical species complexes. Thus, an evaluation of the predictive efficiency ofTWI calculation methods at the local community scale is a crucial step to study local determinants oftropical tree species’ niche.In this study we tested the effects of a set of topographic wetness index variants on the communitycomposition of trees in a neotropical forest. We investigated the consistency of communitycomposition response to TWI with hilltop and lowland classifications already available for thestudied species. We further studied the phylogenetic signal of species association with TWI toexplore niche differentiation mechanisms in the local community.Combining spatially explicit inventories, botanical determination and LiDAR-derived topographicdata over 120 ha of permanent plots in French Guiana, we used a Bayesian modelling framework toinfer a joint species distribution model. We relied on a hydrogeology-based algorithm to computeten different indexes of topographic wetness and compared their information criteria in a modelselection process. We classified the effect of TWI for each species based on the sign of thecredibility interval. We used Blomberg’s K and variance partitioning to explore the phylogeneticsignal of species association with TWI.Our results demonstrate that TWI is an integrative proxy for local-scale community patterns oftropical trees. Using a joint species modelling of the TWI effect on species distribution, we foundthat several species differed from their classification in the literature, questioning their true habitatpreference. The phylogenetic analysis of the TWI effect on species distribution shows that the
preference. The phylogenetic analysis of the TWI effect on species distribution shows that thehydro-edaphic niche differentiation is present for more genera than previously described. Theseresults highlight the interest of adapted continuous proxy to retrieve fine scale community assemblyalong studied gradient and shed light on the mechanisms behind habitat specialisation of tropical trees'
