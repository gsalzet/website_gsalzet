Iâ€™m **Guillaume**, a **forest bioeconomist** at the French National Forest Agency ([ONF](https://www.onf.fr/)).

My research focuses on the **forest sector** and its interactions with **forest dynamics** in the context of the **french forest sector** (mainland & overseas territories). 

I am currently working on a seamless evaluation of coupled biophysical & market models. 
The goal is to provide expected wood-market trajectories under climate changes scenarios at both national and regional scales.
