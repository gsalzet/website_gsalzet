# Biography
Hi, Iâ€™m Guillaume ! Iâ€™m a PhD student in bioeconomics modelling.
My research focuses on the sustainability of forest sector and their interactions with tropical forest dynamics in the context of French Guiana. I am also interested in the forests ecosystems services and how their are evaluated.
