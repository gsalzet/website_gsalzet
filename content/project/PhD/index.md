title: 'PhD Project: Etude de la durabilité de la filière forêt bois de Guyane française - Approche spatialisée de modélisation des services écosystémiques'
summary: 'French Guiana, with its vast tropical rainforest covering 96% of its territory, is a key biodiversity hotspot
in France. However, this biodiversity is under threat from increasing logging to meet growing social
demand. The French government, the main owner of Guyana's forests, manages them via the Office
National des Forêts, with a conservation policy and low-impact logging methods.

The aim of this thesis is to provide an integrated analysis of conservation and timber production issues
in French Guiana. The first chapter provides the historical and current specificities of the forest sector,
highlighting its economic importance while also undelaying the pressures exerted on forest
ecosystems. The following chapters examine the different dimensions of forest management in
French Guiana.

Chapter 2 assesses the evolution of tree species composition on a regional scale, highlighting the
impact of geomorphology and hydro-edaphic conditions on species diversity. Issues of production,
carbon storage and tree species richness are mapped based on these data and analysed in relation
to the location of forest management areas.

Chapters 3 and 4 focus on the impacts of logging, examining tree mortality induced by logging roads
and felling gaps, as well as subsequent resilience trajectories. The results show that, despite lowimpact
logging practices, no set of management parameters can guarantee a return to the prelogging
state within a timeframe compatible with the production objective.

In conclusion, this thesis highlights the need to rethink ecological sustainability in French Guiana, and
more broadly in the tropics, to ensure that ecosystems continue to function. Rather than focusing
solely on maintaining their state, it highlights the importance of an integrated approach between
ecology and economics to guarantee the functioning of tropical forest ecosystems.
