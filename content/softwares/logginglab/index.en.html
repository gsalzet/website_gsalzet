<p><code>LoggingLab</code>: A new individual-based and spatially-explicit logging simulator.</p>
<p><code>LoggingLab</code> simulates the different logging stages taking into account the topography and the hydrographic network, the main spatial constraints for mechanisation.</p>
<p><code>LoggingLab</code> has been developed to diagnose, quantify and spatialise the impact of logging.</p>
<p><code>LoggingLab</code> can be used together with any individual-based and spatially explicit forest dynamics simulator like TROLL (see rcontroll) or SEIBâ€“DGVM (Sato et al., 2007) to observe the effects of logging over time on the forest stand and the resilience of each forest to different logging scenarios.</p>
